This plugin provides tools for running an IRC meeting.  Currently
it supports hand raising and scripts for opening, closing and
managing meeting agendas.  Meeting open and close commands require
channel operator capability.


This plugin was inspired by http://civicspacelabs.org/developers/meetings

I have collected ideas from many folks.  Thank you very much.
If you use this plugin to conduct meetings please let me know.


# To do: combine agenda tracking with questions and Poll.py type capabilities
# To do: queue of questions, difficult to automate, best left to the moderator
#        for now until a solid spec is provided.
